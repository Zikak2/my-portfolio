           I am a beginner in the IBM course - Introduction to HTML, CSS and Javascript. Since I am now at the end of this course, I hope to continue and complete the full Full-Stack JavaScript Developer program and get a professional certificate.
          I have no experience in programming until now, but I hope to deal with it in the future.

          Jane is a very quick learner and quickly grasps key concepts of Web development. 
          She got a great attitude & she is an excellent team player. 
          She has a curious mind and asks the right question. 
          She takes initiative within a team and has potentials to lead the team.

          Working with Jane has been an awesome experience. 
          She is highly knowledgable and always goes the extra step to make sure everything is right. 
          For any future projects that need her expertise I would definitely want to work with her again.

          I had worked along with Jane during the initial phase of our venture which needed Web development. 
          She is a committed resource who has in depth knowledge about the domain. 
          She will be an asset for any organisation!

            For now, it is a pleasure to learn this IBM course and I hope to continue on Jane's path.

          You have done a great job on these courses, but it just lacks a little more interaction with the lecturers, in my opinion. However, this is my first course, so I hope there will be more interaction in the future.

          First of all, I have to say that I took only one course - Introduction to Html, CSS and Javascript. The experience is good so far, I have only one suggestion and that is to have more examples and practice
          <span>&#8221;</span>

           Congratulations, I hope you plan to include lectures in some other languages, for example in a language from the people of the former Yugoslavia, if you have heard of Yugoslavia at all. :)

            You could update the lectures on the courses to 2024. In the 2 examples I worked on, the action is in the year 2022. Maybe something in the applications has changed in those 2 years, so that's why I emphasize it.
